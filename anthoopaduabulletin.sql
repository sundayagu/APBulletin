Cyriacus Emedolu.</u></i></b>\r\nAs I read through the scriptures about the stories of the poor righteous and their powerful enemies, It is amazing that they all ended in an awe inspiring manner. Cast your mind back to the story of Joesph and the untold hardship he suffered. At the end he escaped from the snares and schemes of his brothers. The Israelites once slaves in Egypt. Their experience were nonetheless excruciating but at the end, they escaped. Remember the snare laid for the pious woman, Susanna. More examples abound in the scripture and the Psalmist narrates the exhilarating testimonies of the â€˜poor righteousâ€™ in these words â€œPraise the Lord, who did not let their teeth tear us apart! We escaped like bird from a hunterâ€™s trap. The snare has been broken and we have escapedâ€ (Ps 124:7)\r\nChild of God, does it strike you that the stories of the travails of the children of God always have the same ending? It is because God is the one who decides how the story will end and his stance is always clear in the pendulum of history. God has pitched tent with the broken hearted and saves the crushed in spirit. His eyes are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their trouble (Ps 34: 15-19). Are you persecuted for your faith, generousity, dedication to the law of God and undiluted love for truth and justice? Are you held captive by a particular sin? Or living in bondage of sin? Whatever your predicament may be, the profound stories of the â€˜poor righteous â€˜ cast a light of hope to your escape from the vicious hands of adversities and slavery to sin.\r\nSo, God thinks of you and plans for your escape from bondage to freedom. Notice the assuring words God spoke to Moses on account of the bondage of his people in Egypt. I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their task masters. God has taken side with his people in their predicament and therefore come down to deliver them. Indeed â€œthe snare has been broken and we have escaped.â€        '),

Fr. Rufus Arji F.J.S</u></i></b>\r\n<b><i><u>Email: arji.rufus@gmail.com Contact: 08135409346 (SMS ONLY)</u></i></b>\r\nâ€œEvery believer is a king and a profet. I consider it providential to begin my monthly reflections with you in this month of November when the Nigerian Christians marshal out in their numbers to publicly demonstrate and declare to the world that â€œJesus Christ is the kingâ€. We are thus poised to make a case for the kingship of believers in Christ\r\nThe truth is that we all believe Christ is the king of Heaven and Earth. But that truth is incomplete. The complete truth is that, in Christ, every true believer is endued with a kingly anointing that empowers him to rule in the face of fierce opposition. Child of God, does it strike you that the stories of the travails of the children of God always have the same ending? It is because God is the one who decides how the story will end and his stance is always clear in the pendulum of history. God has pitched tent with the broken hearted and saves the crushed in spirit. His eyes are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their trouble (Ps 34: 15-19). Are you persecuted for your faith, generousity, dedication to the law of God and undiluted love for truth and justice? Are you held captive by a particular sin? Or living in bondage of sin? Whatever your predicament may be, the profound stories of the Government of God. What the does this imply?\r\nFirst we are no longer afraid of the Enemy! Our Kingship in Christ is the one exercised in the midst of adversaries.  Today, the people of God Child of God, does it strike you that the stories of the travails of the children of God always have the same ending? It is because God is the one who decides how the story will end and his stance is always clear in the pendulum of history. God has pitched tent with the broken hearted and saves the crushed in spirit. His eyes are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their trouble (Ps 34: 15-19). Are you persecuted for your faith, generousity, dedication to the law of God and undiluted love for truth and justice? Are you held captive by a particular sin? Or living in bondage of sin? Whatever enemy that you are received an unshakeable kingdom (Heb 12:28). Fear is completely ruled out.\r\nSecond, change your mindset! In the sub-conscious minds of many Christians, they have an image of the Devil that is bigger and more powerful than God. The tragedy of our time our time is that many Christians Child of God, does it strike you that the stories of the travails of the children of God always have the same ending? It is because God is the one who decides how the story will end and his stance is always clear in the pendulum of history. God has pitched tent with the broken hearted and saves the crushed in spirit. His eyes are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their trouble (Ps 34: 15-19). Are you persecuted for your faith, generousity, dedication to the law of God and undiluted love for truth and justice? Are you held captive by a particular sin? Or living in bondage of sin? Whatever your predicament may be, the profound stories of the â€˜poor righteous â€˜ cast a light of hope to your escape from the vicious hands of kingship and nothing less.\r\nI therefore pray for you all, that as you march out to announce the kingship of Jesus Christ, your own kingly position in him may be manifested in all circumstances of life.
